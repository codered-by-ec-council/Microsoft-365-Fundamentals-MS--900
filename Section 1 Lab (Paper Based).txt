Lab - Cloud Fundamentals
Lab Introduction
This lab is comprised of a set of scenarios. Using the knowledge you’ve gained in Module 1, review each
scenario to identify the customer’s requirements, and select which combination of cloud services Infrastructure
as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS), type of cloud
(public, private, or hybrid), and migration (cloud-only or coexistence) best fits their needs.

Scenario 1
Company profile: Northwind Traders
Northwind Traders is a three-generation, family-owned import/export company.

Challenge
The company’s growth over the past several years and their employee demands for better collaboration
tools to connect remote offices around the Pacific Rim are outpacing the company’s small IT team.
The IT lead is spending all her time trying to keep their outdated business systems running. She wants to
be able to upgrade the company’s old Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, which has run out of space.
However, the IT budget is tight, and there would need to be a large up-front investment in new servers,
server licenses, storage, and more. Employee machines are running a mix of Windows 7, 8, and 10 operating
systems, and old versions of Microsoft Office—all with no centralized management of updates.
Furthermore, the proliferation of mobile devices that are frequently connecting to the company’s network
is making her concerned about the potential of an unhealthy device infecting their corporate systems.
Moreover, they’ve been using a free web-based email system that isn’t delivering the business-class
services they need. They want to move completely away from this insecure mail and adopt a business-
class mail system without having to pay huge up-front licensing and hardware costs.

Scenario 2
Company profile: Contoso, Ltd.
Contoso is a large manufacturing corporation with almost 60,000 employees throughout North America.

Challenge
Like many large enterprises, Contoso has developed customized on-premises-based line-of-business
apps for many critical processes. These apps help them with their manufacturing processes, both upstream
from materials suppliers, and downstream to order processing and customer billing.
Many of these systems are old and inflexible, and the IT organization within Contoso is looking for a way
to use the cloud to extend these apps’ capabilities, empowering remote workers, suppliers, and customers
to more easily identify requirements, confirm production, and fill orders.

Scenario 3
Company profile: First Up Consultants
First Up Consultants is a medium-sized consulting firm that builds customized applications for medical
businesses.

Challenge
First Up Consultants wants to be able to rapidly spin up virtual machines (VMs) to test new versions of
their software products. This historically has resulted in major CapEx costs associated with new high-end
servers and storage hardware, along with a significant amount of administrative overhead to plan for and
implement all the hardware updates in the company’s datacenter.
The biggest problem has always been one of accurate forecasting, because they either purchase too
much capacity that goes unused—wasting CapEx resources, or they run out of capacity too soon. They
want to significantly reduce their CapEx, in addition to reducing the administrative overhead associated
with each new wave of hardware. The solution First Up Consultants selects must support any type of
environment customization to suit their development needs—and enable them to reduce charges
whenever a system isn’t needed.
