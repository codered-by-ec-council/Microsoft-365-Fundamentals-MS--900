 IaaS
 PaaS
■■ SaaS
Explanation
SaaS. The company can subscribe to Microsoft 365 to give every employee access to the latest version of
Office productivity tools—including Microsoft Teams, and Skype for Business. These tools, along with
Microsoft SharePoint Online, will significantly improve how the remote offices collaborate with each other.
Office and Windows management will be streamlined by upgrading everyone to the latest versions, and
then utilizing Microsoft 365’s management tools to manage all devices—including mobile devices.

What type of migration model do you recommend? (Choose one)
■■ Cloud-only
 Co-existence
Explanation
Cloud-only migration model. Because the current mail is a free, web-based service that they’ll gladly
move off in in favor of Microsoft Exchange Online, there is no need for coexistence with it. Similarly, moving
their files from their outdated SharePoint Server 2007 to the cloud will enable them to decommission their
old machines.

 IaaS
■■ PaaS
 SaaS
Explanation
PaaS. Because PaaS supports building, testing, and deploying software applications that will connect to
their legacy line-of-business systems, this would be the best choice. Different apps can be purpose-built for
the various roles (such as sales, suppliers, and fulfilment), with each app providing the appropriate access
into the line-of-business systems, securely, and from any mobile device.

■■ IaaS
 PaaS
 SaaS
Explanation
IaaS. This model is perfect for First Up Consultants, because it allows them to host all the VMs that they
need to test with. IaaS gives them control over the hardware that runs their applications, so they can utilize
them only when they’re needed. When they don’t need to run the VMs, they can place them in cheaper
cloud-based storage to reduce compute fees.
