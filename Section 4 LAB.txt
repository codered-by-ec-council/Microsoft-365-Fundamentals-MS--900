Lab Introduction

This lab is designed to reinforce the concepts you were introduced to and the knowledge you've gained
in this module. In this lab, you will use your trial Microsoft 365 account to gain hands-on experience
managing your Microsoft 365 subscription, licensing, and billing settings.
Please note that this lab has three exercises, each with multiple tasks. For a successful outcome, the
exercises and their corresponding tasks must be completed in order.

services. This is where you can add more Microsoft services to your account. Scroll through the list of
available services you can subscribe to in addition to Microsoft 365.
5. In Billing, select Subscriptions. This is where you manage your subscriptions.

including available and assigned licenses, cost, and the trial’s expiration date.
●● In the lower-right section of the main pane, click More actions.
This is where you can add a partner of record to your account, cancel the trial, or install software that’s
associated with your subscription. Spend a few minutes to explore each of these areas, but do not make
any changes.
1. In Billing, select Bills. This is where you can review your subscription’s billing statements.
●● This is the menu where you can select a certain billing period, but because this is a new trial you won’t
have any billing statements available to review.

including regional phone numbers to call for billing support, and updating payment information.

2. Select Select a payment method to review the type (or types) of payment methods that are available
in your region.
3. In Billing, select Licenses. This is where you manage your subscription licenses.
●●Note that for each type of subscription you’ll see the total number of licenses (both valid and expired),
in addition to the number of licenses that are assigned to users.
●● Don’t do anything with your licenses yet; we’ll step through managing licenses in the next exercise.
1. In Billing, select Billing notifications. This is where you can determine who receives automated
emails about Microsoft services billing.
